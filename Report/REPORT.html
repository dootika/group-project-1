<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-anime">1.1 About Anime</h3>
<p>What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear, see the word “ANIME”?</p>
<p>We probably think what is the difference between <em>ANIME</em> and any other media form is. Anime is a term used as alias for hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of “animation” in Japanese, where this term refers to all animation. Anime is prominent among teenagers from middle school to college. It has a lot of relevance with <em>Manga</em>, <em>Light Novels</em> and <em>Games</em>.</p>
<p>An anime is characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Story telling</li>
<li>Character building</li>
<li>Character building</li>
<li>Presentation of thoughts artistically</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is our <em>hypothetical</em> <strong>Problem Statement</strong> for this project:</p>
<p><em>An Indian billionaire wants to invest his money in Animation Industry and hence decides to hire a data analyst so that he could get him a better idea of the market. We, as data analysts are providing him a new tool and our interpretations from the data, so that he could successfully make his debut with a successful and hit anime.</em></p>
<p>For this project, we created a shiny app with R to analyze various factors of the anime and how do they affect the <em>Popularity</em> and <em>Rank</em> of specific animes.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions-we-imposed">1.3 Questions We Imposed</h3>
<p>Here are a few questions laid down by us looking at the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was there any impact of COVID on different aspects of anime (eg. viewership)?</li>
<li>Does a studio house focus on “quality” or “quantity” in the process of making of anime?</li>
<li>What has more audience and viewership: “Movies” or “TV shows”?</li>
<li>Can we identify the Target Audience with maximum viewership?</li>
<li>Can a show be perfectly timed?
<ul>
<li>With respect to premiering:
<ul>
<li>on a particular season?</li>
<li>on a particular month of the year?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With respect to broadcasting episodes:
<ul>
<li>During Weekends (Saturdays, Sundays)</li>
<li>Just before the weekends (Fridays)</li>
<li>Or during any other weekday</li>
</ul></li>

</figure>
</div>
<p>It showed ranks of Anime and had hyperlinks to get into each page for a particular Anime. Every page corresponding to an anime had “spaceit_pad” class in it, which has some of the important variables, but sequencing was different for each anime, making it tough to extract via list slicing.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solutions-we-used-to-tackle-the-aforementioned-issues">3.3 Solutions we used to tackle the aforementioned issues</h3>
<p>To get the codes we made a function “codes(input = number_of_anime )” which automated the process of code extraction.</p>
<p>Then we made an empty dataset with 21 columns (nomenclature mentioned in data description) function “values(input = text element from spaceit_pad class)”. This function took the extracted element of “spaceit” as input, then with grepl function checked that whether the name of column we assigned is present in any of the element of this list. Where it was true it assigned it a value at that particular index and if there was no TRUE value the NA was assigned to the remaining index. The output of this function was for a particular Anime by inputing its “spaceit_pad” and giving a vector of all the information of 21 columns which was later assigned as a row in our data frame</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="duration-season-broadcast-days-column">4.2.1 Duration, Season Broadcast (days) column</h4>
<p>In the duration column we had the data likes “1hr. 20min.”, “24min.”, “52min. pr. Eps”, our final output was a column in which all these values were calculated in minutes. Solution: Analyzed patterns which were recurring, then built a function “dur(entry from duration column)” calculated duration in min.</p>
<p>All the three columns shared common type of problems, in the remaining two it was not possible to directly use substring as index of extraction for each value differed (eg “Sundays at 17:00 JST”, “Unknown”,“Friday at 3:15 JST”), hence for each of them a function was build which had a vector unique entries(in which we want to see the output as, eg new &lt;- c(“Sunday”,“Monday”), this function checked the presence of any element from “new” in the input, if the condition was satisfied then output would be the coinciding vector from “new”.</p>

<p><em>New Animes are popular than Old</em></p>
<p>Probable reasons: Lack of data of Animes before 1990 can give rise to bias in data. Moreover, Animation tools are much more advanced now than they were before 90s leading to more interactive visuals.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">7. CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Concluding this project we were able to build an app which would help us to make different templates of the preferred combination of different characterstic variables (genre, broadcast day, studios, etc.. ), we used in our analysis.</p>
<p>We can notice that there is no specific combination of charactersitics which guarantees a hit anime but it depends on how the person who is making the Anime wants to make it.</p>
<p>For particular choice of characterstic, example the target audience we can find different combination of factors which increases its popularity as well as score.</p>
<p>Also it depends on the external factors such as the money, which is to be invested and specific intention or goal for which the Anime is made. For example, an anime depicting protection of environment, which is meant for a nobel cause and hence we would want it to be highly popular irrespective of score, so that awareness could be spread across a variety audience. Moreover, we have already seen that it is not necessary that high score of an anime means that it is very popular too.</p>
